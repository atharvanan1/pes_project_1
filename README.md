Contents:
1. Program 1 folder - program_1.c file, ProgramOne.out file which contains output, and script.sh to run the compilation, and copy the output to file ProgramOne.out.
2. Program 2 folder - program_2.c file, ProgramTwo.out file which contains output, and script.sh to run the compilation, and copy the output to file ProgramTwo.out.
3. Program 3 folder - program_3.c file, ProgramThree.out file which contains output, and script.sh to run the compilation, and copy the output to file ProgramThree.out.

To run each program, on Linux - ./script.sh - this will compile a fresh copy, put the output in ProgramXXX.out file, and print the output on the screen for others to see. On Windows - use a compiler to compile main.c files, and then execute the compiled file.

All files are compiled using `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -o prog_name prog_name.c`.
